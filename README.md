# Robot Dynamics

This is the repository for the code files of the **Robot Dynamics** lecture at the [Robotic Systems Lab](http://www.rsl.ethz.ch/) and [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://asl.ethz.ch) at ETH Zurich taught by Prof. Dr. Marco Hutter and Prof. Dr. Roland Siegwart. The lecture covered the following topics:

- Forward Kinematics 
    - Analytic and Geometric/Basic Jacobian
- Inverse Kinematic Control Methods:
    -  Inverse Differential Kinematics
    -  Multi-Task Inverse Differential Kinematics Control (equal  and varied prioritization)
    - Numerical Solution to Inverse Kinematics control
        - Trajectory control for position and orientation
- Floating base robots
    - Soft and Hard Contact/Support Consistent constraints
- Dynamics
    - Rigid body kinematics and dynamics 
    - Dynamic Controls
        - Joint impedance control
        - Inverse dynamics control
        - Task space dynamics control
        - Hybrid-Motion-Force control
        - Floating base system control
- Non-linear controllers
    - Attitude and postion control
- State estimation
- Motion planning
- Conceptual understanding of robot types
- Robotic arms (e.g., ABB IRB 120)
- Legged robotic systems
    - Series Elastic Actuators
- Modeling fixed-wing aircrafts
    - Aircraft design and control concepts
    - Aerodynamics in robotics
- Rotorcrafts  
    - Helicopter types in robotics
    - Quadrotors
    - Coaxial configuration in UAVs
- Case studies in robotics
- State of the art in robotics (e.g., Deep Reinforcement Learning)

The repository contains a folder with the code to the problem sets as well as the code to the two (optional) mid-term projects, where all of the theoretical knowledge of the lecture had to be applied.
